          be a really useful tool to further understanding or to fix a problem.  However, it's only useful if you get the correct answer.  And to do that, you must ask good questions.  Whether specifically  asking questions online or to someone else, it's important to be concise.  So here are a few tips about asking good questions:
        </p>


        <p>
       <!--paragraph-->
          -First, have you tried searching for the answer to your question?  If not, go ahead and do that first,  If you haven't been able to fond the answer, then go ahead and ask.<br><br>
          -If online, the title stating the question is very important.  It should be specific, yet brief, and should give most all of the necessary information needed to answer it.  For example, from a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">stackoverflow article</a>, this title is not helpful: "C# Math Confusion." A much better question to ask would be "Why does using float instead of int give me different results when all of my inputs are integers?" You should be able to sum up your question into a sentence. <br><br>
          -Add to the body of the question with specific details, including sample code so that your problem can be reproduced, and hopefully fixed, by those answering your question.<br><br>
          -Make sure your grammar, spelling, and punctuation are readable.  You want to be taken seriously, and it's just harder to read when there are misspelled words everywhere, or there's a paragraph with no punctuation.<br><br>
          -Also, be patient and polite.  Sometimes, us humans read something and think it says/means one thing when it really said/meant another.
        </p>
