      <h4>My Reflection</h4>
        <h5>What parts of your strategy worked? What problems did you face?</h5>
          <p>Since this was a pairing session, our strategy was to focus on the tasks at hand first, and then we would add anything else that we wanted later.</p>
        <h5>What questions did you have while coding? What resources did you find to help you answer them?</h5>
          <p>The biggest question we had was "why is this CSS not working???" Eventually we figured it out just by playing around with it.  CSS is very nuanced.  You have to put things exactly where they need to go or else it won't work.</p>
        <h5>What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?</h5>
          <p>We were having a few issues with media queries to begin with, and the also CSS positioning.  So that was interesting. Viktor understood Chrome Dev tools more than me, which was helpful because I'm still trying to get a handle on it.</p>
        <h5>Did you learn any new skills or tricks?</h5>
          <p>I learned about media queries, and I can say they make much more sense to me than they had when I was reading about them.  Also how to change from pixels to ems and percentages.</p>
        <h5>How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?</h5>
          <p>I'm pretty confident, but I definitely need to go over these concepts a little more.</p>
        <h5>Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?</h5>
          <p>I enjoyed figuring stuff out.  When something worked it was a "huzzah!" moment, for sure.</p>
        <h5>Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?</h5>
          <p>I found that figuring out was the directions meant was pretty tedious.  A few of the directions could have been clearer--we spent a good portion of the time guessing and questioning what they actually meant and if what we had done was what they wanted.</p>
