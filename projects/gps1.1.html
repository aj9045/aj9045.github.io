            <h1><a name="one">OUR FIRST PAIR PROGRAMMING!</a></h1>
                <p>AJ &amp; Michael Angelo</p>
            <h2><a name="two">What is pair programming?</a></h2>
                <p>Two programmers working together on a project.</a></p>
            <h2><a name="three">Why is pair programming important to DBC?</a></h2>
                <p>It builds that level of interaction that people are missing these days.  It improves interfacing, and skills that you'll be using later as a professional developer.</p>
            <h2><a name="four">Compare Driver and Navigator</a></h2>
                <p>The driver and navigator are similar, where the driver will take the lead, and the navigator will guide.</p>
            <h2><a name="five">The FUN stuff!!!!</a></h2>

                <div>
                    <p>Question:  What was it like to pair for the first time?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Michael: It was great, we both have so many ideas, it was nice to hear that we both had trouble with the CSS aspects of programming.  It was also nice to actually talk to someone over the phone and get to know some of the people ill be around for the next 9 weeks!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>AJ: Yeah, it was nice to pair with someone that I'll be working with in person in a few weeks.  We were able to bounce ideas off of each other, which I thought was a pretty fun process.  </p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Question: Did you enjoy it?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Michael:  I loved it!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>AJ:  I did, too! </p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Question:  What worked?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Michael:  Stypi was a good tool, and in the end I was proud of what we did in an hour and 1/2!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>AJ: We also screen shared in Google Hangouts, which turned out to work really well..</p>
                    <br><br>
                    <p>Question:  What didn't work?</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Michael:  Okay, so the hangout link that I got from DBC didn't work :(, I spent about twenty minutes trying to get connected, until Jonathan just sent me a message asking if I was gonna be able to join.  Then the hangout session wouldn't connect over all of our computers, we ended up talking over the phone while the hangout connected our faces, and coded in the stypi.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>AJ: The audio for Google Hangouts just wasn't cooperating with us today even though it worked yesterday.  I tried it on Safari, too, and it just wouldn't load.  So talking over the phone was a good idea.</p>
