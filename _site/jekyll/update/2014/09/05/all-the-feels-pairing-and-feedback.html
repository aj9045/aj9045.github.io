          <p>Pairing is definitely a first for me, an entirely new experience. In fact, using Google Hangouts to meet someone for the first time is new to me.  And we weren&#39;t just meeting, but we actually worked together, and it eventually felt like we were coworkers that had been working with each other for a while.  To be honest, though, before pairing for the first time in Phase 0, I was terrified.  I get super anxious when meeting people for the first time or when I&#39;m around people I don&#39;t know very well.  And while I can say I&#39;m no longer terrified, I still get nervous before a pairing session.  Part of me feels that I have nothing useful to contribute, part of me feels like that I might let my pair down, or that I might just be getting in their way.  And I also realize that this is partially based in a fixed mindset.  But, I&#39;m trying to grow out of that and into a growth mindset, and it&#39;s actually pretty difficult.  I find that if I can do something once, then I&#39;ll probably be able to be successful at it again, and that&#39;s what keeps me going and what helps me muffle the self-doubt and overly self-critical thoughts.</p>

<p>But, I also like pairing.  I&#39;m an introvert, but I also like working in  groups in order to bounce ideas off each other.  While pairing, I have had a really good time for the most part.  I&#39;ve learned what I like and what I don&#39;t like during a pairing session.  And most of the time, I found pairing to be really beneficial: I was able to work with someone who was interested in the same thing and learn from them.  I hope I was able to give back to the team as well at some point.  It was a little frustrating when we both had no idea what to do next, but when that happened it seemed it was best to take a quick break and play around with the code on our own, and then reconvene. It is also extremely rewarding when you and your pair finish a challenge together, or when there&#39;s an epiphany and you both figure out something you&#39;d been stuck on for a while.  Good feels.</p>

<p>And even though pairing is really a great tool, there were a couple of times when a pairing session just wasn&#39;t that great.  This didn&#39;t happen often, but sometimes I just didn&#39;t feel like I clicked with my pair.  I still tried to do my best, but I felt uneasy the whole time, and I couldn&#39;t figure out why I felt that way, which was frustrating because then I couldn&#39;t try to fix it or even verbalize my feelings.  This was similar to how I feel when giving feedback.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never been very good at verbalizing my feelings and emotions. And giving feedback to a pair after a session was difficult for me.  If something bothered me, most of the time if there had been a reason, I couldn&#39;t remember it, or I didn&#39;t even know the reason. I also found it difficult to give feedback that was actionable if I felt that everything went well. I&#39;m still working on giving actionable and specific feedback, though, so I should be getting better at that as I pair more.</p>

<p>When I was in high school, I took creative writing, and in college I took a bunch of art classes.  Because of this, I am pretty open to feedback about myself.  I never take it as true criticism, but as constructive criticism.  Sometimes when I read feedback, I already know what I need to work on, and sometimes it&#39;s a surprise.  But kind of like getting critique on your painting or short story, you can choose what suggestions to take.  While most all of the suggestions I do take seriously, sometimes when I read something and I don&#39;t really understand where it came from, I just say &quot;okay&quot; and move on.  That being said, I really do appreciate feedback.  It&#39;s not only helpful when dealing with your work, but also when dealing with yourself as a person.  The positive feedback I&#39;ve received includes that I have a good attitude, I&#39;m not afraid to ask questions, and that I&#39;m open to trying out different strategies.  Things I need to work on, though, include speaking up more with my own ideas, do a little more independent research on the concepts at hand, and not be afraid of saying when I don&#39;t know something (which I seem to be getting much better at).  And for feedback from me for me, I realize I need to be more confident and be more decisive (I, for some reason, have a had time making decisions).  These won&#39;t happen overnight, but I&#39;ll definitely work on it and try to improve on these things for my next pairing session.</p>
