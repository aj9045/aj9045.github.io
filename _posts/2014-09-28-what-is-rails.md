Coming into Dev Bootcamp, I knew we'd be learning Ruby on Rails.  I said that with confidence, but I really had no idea what Ruby on Rails was.

We should first start with a quick definition of Ruby.  Ruby is a programming language, most known for its use in web development.  It focuses on simplicity and productivity, and easy to read syntax.

Ruby on Rails, also known as "Rails" or "RoR", is an open source framework for Web development in Ruby.  Open source means that it is a piece of software that anyone can use and change as they see fit.  Rails is kind of like an add on to Ruby, that extends its functions and gives Ruby new abilities. And in turn, you can "add on" to Rails with Ruby gems.

So why should we use Ruby on Rails?  Well, for starters, it's great for simplifying code and keeping it DRY, which stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself." Rails is used to build web apps by combining Ruby with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It uses conventions, or established rules, to do this by making it easier and less work for the developer.

The Ruby on Rails community is pretty popular, and it's opens source, so there is a lot of information online to get you started and keep you going, including free courses and tutorials.  It's also considered a relatively easy language to learn, and because it's full-stack, if you start out with Rails, you'll learn a bit of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Ruby along the way.  Complex websites are easily implemented with Rails, which can be great for startups and general creativity.

So far I've learned a bit of HTML/CSS, Ruby, JavaScript, and I'm looking forward to creating something with a little of all of these using Rails.
