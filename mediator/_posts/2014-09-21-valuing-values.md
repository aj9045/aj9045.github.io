There are certain values that are more important to me than others.  It took me a good few minutes to come up with them, as I had to think back and see how they took part in my life.

  Accomplishment, Close Relationships, Compassion, Cooperation, Creativity, Growth, Honesty, Inspiration, Meaningful Work, Respect

These values are those that I care about most.

All of these are pretty important to me. The most important, however, would probably be inspiration.

I've been struggling, for lack of a better word, with depression for years, and inspiration is what gets me up in the morning (I am also really not a morning person).  Whether is inspiration to clean my room, take a walk, get work done, or whatever, it's something I need.  I honestly wouldn't be able to get out of bed without some sort of inspiration, and some days, it's very hard to find any.

I think that meaningful work, also falls into a similar category.  Inspiration to do meaningful work.  And what I've found, that has helped me a bit, is that meaningful work to you might be completely different to someone else's meaningful work.  Someone else might not find writing a poem productive because it's not <em>work</em> work, but if you're the one doing it and you feel it benefits you, then why can't it be meaningful?

I was asked to rate the list of values I previously chose as the  most important.  In general, I try to live up to these values, from 1 (disagree) to 5 (agree).  However, I'm a little unsure as to how the statement was worded.  "I try to live up to these values."  I think I would put 5 for most all of them.  For the values we value most, shouldn't we be striving to live up to them?

I was also asked what the last topic that someone asked for your advice on.  My parents were packing for a trip and my dad asked whether or not his shirts and pants went together.  The advice I gave wasn't spectacular, but it was honest, and that's what was needed.  And I really value the close relationship we have because I'm able to say, "no, that looks bad--try the shirt with those pants instead," knowing that my suggestion was respected whether or not he took it or not. And that's about a third of my most important values list right there.

I talked about stereotype threat in a previous blog post.  And when I think about these values, I think that when/if I do recognize I feel stereotype threat, I can use them to my advantage.  As I said previously, I'm not very aware of stereotype threat's effect on me.  That might just be because I just don't pay attention, or it's subconscious.

I was talking with my dad once, and he pointed out that I'm rather introspective.  I hadn't really thought about that before, but I realized that was very true.  And that can be both a good and bad thing.  I think now that I know that stereotype threat is actually a real thing, I'll be able first, identify when I feel it, and second, be able to alleviate it with my values.
